    "description": "<p>Dynamic code for case 1 reported in the paper. The scenario refers to the data reported by Payne, R.J. and Jansen, V.A. \"Understanding Bacteriophage Therapy as a Density-Dependent Kinetic Process\", J. Theor. Biol. 2001, 208, 37\u201348.</p>\n<p>The default values for the parameters below as well as the ODEs are set according to the paper. The output of this computation is the plot of the densities of the hypothetical bacterial and phagial populations. The plot has been extended five-fold with respect to the work of Payne and Jansen (100 hours versus 20 hours).</p>\n<p>The user can have a feeling on how phage therapy depends on case-specific conditions by modifying the parameters using the slider below. The list of parameters is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>t\u1d62\u2099 = time of administration of the phage dose (h)</li>\n<li>v\u1d62\u2099 = amount of the phage dose (PFU/mL)</li>\n<li>S\u2080 = initial density of susceptible bacteria (CFU/mL)</li>\n<li>K = carrying capacity of the environment (CFU/mL)</li>\n<li>\u03bc = maximum growth rate of the bacteria (1/h)</li>\n<li>\u03c9 = outflow of the environment (1/mL)</li>\n<li>\u03b4 = infection rate of the phage (1/min)</li>\n<li>\u03b7 = inverse of latency time (min)</li>\n<li>\u03bb = degradation rate of the phage (1/day)</li>\n<li>\u03b2 = burst size of the phage (PFU)</li>\n</ul>",
